This major update focuses on refining performance, enhancing developer experience, and providing more explicit control over caching and routing. Whether you're upgrading an existing project or starting fresh, Next.js 16 introduces tools that make development faster and your apps more efficient.\n\nIn this post, we'll break down the key features of Next.js 16, explain why they matter, and show you how to get started. From stable Turbopack to innovative Cache Components, get ready to level up your frontend workflow.\n\n## Stable Turbopack: Blazing-Fast Builds and Dev Servers\n\nOne of the headline features in Next.js 16 is the stabilization of Turbopack, Vercel's Rust-based bundler that's now the default for both development (`next dev`) and production builds (`next build`).<grok-card data-id=\"8c033a\" data-type=\"citation_card\"></grok-card> This shift from Webpack promises dramatic speed improvements without any configuration changes for new projects.\n\n### Key Performance Gains\n- **Up to 10x faster Fast Refresh**: Your changes appear in the browser almost instantly during development, reducing iteration time.\n- **2x to 5x faster production builds**: CI/CD pipelines will thank you for the reduced wait times.\n- **Filesystem Caching (Beta)**: Compiler artifacts are now stored on disk, speeding up subsequent dev server restarts in large projects.<grok-card data-id=\"4e1e55\" data-type=\"citation_card\"></grok-card>\n\nFor existing apps relying on custom Webpack setups, you can opt out by running `next dev --no-turbo` or `next build --no-turbo`.<grok-card data-id=\"5afd77\" data-type=\"citation_card\"></grok-card> But with these gains, why would you?\n\n> \"Turbopack isn't just faster—it's a complete rethinking of the bundling process, making Next.js feel snappier from the first `npm run dev`.\"\n\nTo try it, create a new project:  \n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@16 my-next-app\ncd my-next-app\nnpm run dev","slug":"nextjs-16-features"}]
